                The map consists of nodes, some of which are connected by edges. Nodes are defined by x and y
                coordinate.
                Each player starts with <const>3</const> units on one side of the map.
                Then the players try to capture a triangle by owning all three corner nodes of it.
                They can use a triangle to spawn a new unit, kill all opponent units on a given node, add or remove a
                connection between two nodes.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Moving units</strong><br>
                Units can be moved from a node to one of the direct neighbors each turn.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Node ownership</strong><br>
                A node is owned, when the player has strictly more units on it than the opponent player or when all
                neighboring nodes are owned by that player.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Surrounded units</strong><br>
                When a unit is surrounded by opponent nodes, meaning each neighboring node is owned by the opponent, the
                unit is killed.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Triangles</strong><br>
                A triangle is defined by three nodes, that are all connected with each other.<br>
                After each turn the players get <const>1</const> point for each triangle they currently own.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Capturing a triangle</strong><br>
                To capture a triangle, a player has to own all three corners of it and be eligible to claim the
                triangle.
                Initially the players can capture all triangles. This will only change after using them.
                A captured triangle will remain in the ownership of the player until it's used or captured by the
                opponent.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Using a triangle</strong><br>
                When owning a triangle, a player can use it to perform one of the actions described below.
                This will make the triangle neutral again. The player using it can only capture it again after moving
                all units away from each node or after it got captured by the opponent player. <br>
                <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                    Some usages have an additional cost, meaning that the player loses a certain amount of units on each
                    node of the triangle. If the player doesn't have enough units on each node, the triangle can't be
                    used. In order to use a unit, it must have been there for the whole turn and not just moved or
                    spawned there.
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <strong>Spawning a unit</strong><br>
                One way to use a triangle is to spawn a unit. This will place a unit on one node of the triangle. The
                player can decide the corner to spawn on. Spawning has no cost.

                <br><br>
                <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                    <strong>Attacking a node</strong><br>
                    A triangle can be used to attack a node, killing all opponent units on it. This action has a cost of
                    <const>1</const>. The attacked node has to be adjacent to at least one node of the used triangle.

            The game turn works as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><span style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1);">

            <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                Within the same type of action, actions are applied for both players simultaneously, but sequentially
                for the
                same player. <br>
                Example: <br>
                Player 1 wants to perform two attack actions <const>A1a</const> and <const>A1b</const>.
                Player 2 wants to perform two attack actions <const>A2a</const> and <const>A2b</const>.
                First <const>A1a</const> and <const>A2a</const> will be checked for being valid (the triangles in use are owned by the respective players and they have
                enough units on each node) and applied if possible.
                Then <const>A1b</const> and <const>A2b</const> will be processed in the same way. It's possible that the first group of actions renders one of them
                invalid by killing units on a triangle that was supposed to be used later.
