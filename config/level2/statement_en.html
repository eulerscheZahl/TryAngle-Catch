                The map consists of houses, some of which are connected by paths. Houses are defined by x and y
                coordinate.
                Each player starts with <const>3</const> units on one side of the map.
                Then the players try to capture a triangle by owning all three corner houses of it.
                They can use a triangle to spawn a new unit, kill all opponent units on a given house and add or remove a
                path between two houses.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Moving units</strong><br>
                Units can be moved from a house to one of the direct neighbors each turn.

                <br><br>
                <strong>House ownership</strong><br>
                A house is owned, when the player has strictly more units on it than the opponent player or when all
                neighboring houses are owned by that player.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Surrounded units</strong><br>
                When a unit is surrounded by opponent houses, meaning each neighboring house is owned by the opponent, the
                unit is killed.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Triangles</strong><br>
                A triangle is defined by three houses, that are all connected with each other. A triangle may not contain any other houses inside itself.<br>
                After each turn the players get <const>1</const> point for each triangle they currently own.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Capturing a triangle</strong><br>
                To capture a triangle, a player has to own all three corners of it and be eligible to claim the
                triangle.
                Initially the players can capture all triangles. This will only change after using them.
                A captured triangle will remain in the ownership of the player until it's used or captured by the
                opponent.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Using a triangle</strong><br>
                When owning a triangle, a player can use it to perform one of the actions described below.
                This will make the triangle neutral again. The player using it can only capture it again after moving
                all units away from each house or after it got captured by the opponent player. <br>
                <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                    Some usages have an additional cost, meaning that the player loses a certain amount of units on each
                    house of the triangle. If the player doesn't have enough units on each house, the triangle can't be
                    used. In order to use a unit, it must have been there for the whole turn and not just moved or
                    spawned there.
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <strong>Spawning a unit</strong><br>
                One way to use a triangle is to spawn a unit. This will place a unit on one house of the triangle. The
                player can choose the corner to spawn on.
                <span style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                Spawning has no cost.
                </span>
                <br><br>

                <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                    <strong>Attacking a house</strong><br>
                    A triangle can be used to attack a house, killing all opponent units on it. This action has a cost of
                    <const>1</const>. The attacked house has to be adjacent to at least one house of the used triangle.

            <br> <br>
            The game turn works as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><span style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1);">
                Apply attack actions</span></li>
                <li>Move units</li>
                <li>Spawn units</li>
                <li>Kill surrounded units</li>
                <li>Change ownership of triangles</li>
            </ol>
            <div style="color: #7cc576; background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1); padding: 2px;">
                Within the same type of action, actions are applied for both players simultaneously, but sequentially
                for the
                same player. <br>
                Example: <br>
                Player 1 wants to perform two attack actions <const>A1a</const> and <const>A1b</const>.
                Player 2 wants to perform two attack actions <const>A2a</const> and <const>A2b</const>.
                First <const>A1a</const> and <const>A2a</const> will be checked for being valid (the triangles in use are owned by the respective players and they have
                enough units on each house) and applied if possible.
                Then <const>A1b</const> and <const>A2b</const> will be processed in the same way. It's possible that the first pair of actions renders one of the later ones
                invalid by killing units on a triangle that was supposed to be used later.
